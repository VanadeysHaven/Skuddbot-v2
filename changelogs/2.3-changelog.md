### Reworked
- [Daily Bonus rework!](https://wiki.skuddbot.xyz/systems/daily-bonus)
  - Multiplier and streak are now desperate.
    - The multiplier increases and decreases at the same rate as your streak, but is capped.
      - Server admins can control this cap using the `DAILY_BONUS_MULTIPLIER_CAP` setting.
    - New users start at multiplier 15x.
    - Existing users start at their streak (capped at cap setting).
  - Weekly bonus
    - You can now gain weekly bonuses every 7 days, regardless of whether you are at the cap or not.
    - Every 7 days you'll gain double the rewards.
    - Days don't count when you're frozen. 
  - Frozen days: *brrr... it's getting cold in here*
    - Every missed day will now gain you a frozen day.
    - Frozen days are used up on every subsequent claim until they run out.
    - When frozen your streak and multiplier will not increase. Nor will your multiplier be applied.
    
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where if message level ups were disabled by the server admins, it would always be a reaction notification despite the user picking DM or NONE.
- Fixed an issue where hidden stat categories would still show.
- Fixed an issue where the challenged party in challenge would not get charged the bet.
- Fixed an issue where you could not place bets on open challenges.
- Fixed an issue where challenge would show the "insufficient currency" error but still started the game with no bet.
- Several typo's.
